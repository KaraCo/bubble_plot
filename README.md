# bubble_plot
Hi everyone and thanks for coming!
The goal for the bubble function is to help us visualize relations between features in our data in an easy in simple way.
It suits categorical as well as numerical features.
The bubble plot receives is a 2 dimensional histogram of bubbles.
The bubble size is proportional to the frequency of the data points in this point.
For numerical features the features will be presented in buckets (10 equally spaced bins will be used as default).
For categorical features the features will be presented according to their categories.
You can plot a numerical features vs. another numerical feature or a categorical feature vs another categorical features.
Normalization by all means joint distribution p(x,y), if it is false we see the conditional distribution of y vs. x p(y/x).
Please let me know if you have any questions. My email is meir.shir86@gmail.com.
Enjoy,
